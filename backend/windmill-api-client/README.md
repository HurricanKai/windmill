# Windmill API Client

This holds an autogenerated OpenAPI client in Rust. It's exclusively used in the backend to talk to the [api server](../windmill-api/).

## Generate

Simply run `sh regenerate.sh`. And the relevant source files will appear.
This requires the swagger-cli to be installed for bundling, and openapi-generator for code generation.
